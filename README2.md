What is Mutual Information?

    Mutual Information (MI) measures how much information one variable tells us about another.

It answers:

    "If I know the value of X, how much does that reduce my uncertainty about Y?"

Score individual features based on how much info they give about the target.

- its Supervised (uses target info!)
- Captures both linear & nonlinear relationships

- MI score tells how useful each feature is You keep the original features. but when we use PCA it gives Transformed "components" (not original features)

- PCA only captures Only linear (unless you use Kernel PCA) and      Unsupervised (ignores target). but when we use MI, it is Supervised  (uses target info!). 

- MI Score individual features based on how much info they give about the target

# (SVD) Single value decomposition

In Simple Words:

    SVD breaks down a matrix into 3 smaller, special matrices â€” kind of like breaking a complex shape into its core building blocks.
